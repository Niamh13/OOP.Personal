  Finished the Fish side of the app class
  Finished the base of each fish type and fish class

  As it stands now the code doesn't work with [Help 1] coming up

  Starting on changing to Array of object for edit:
      1. Add Fish
      2. Add Boat
      3. Search
      4. Print
* Going to use this to refine the App class and add a UI class to go with the super and sub classes *
* Would it be more effective and clearer if theres one UI for fish and another for company, going to try with one first *

* Adding in a view game for the user "to go fishing" to see the information on the fish and companys *

  Need to find a way to include inheritance
  Need to find a way to connect the CoOrdinate class and Fish class (maybe inheritance but which way)
  Might make a petition sign up to help with making change to have another class
