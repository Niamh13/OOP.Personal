  Finished the Fish side of the app class
  Finished the base of each fish type and fish class

  As it stands now the code doesn't work with [Help 1] coming up

  Starting on changing to Array of object for edit:
      1. Add Fish
      2. Add Boat
      3. Search
      4. Print
* Going to use this to refine the App class and add a UI class to go with the super and sub classes *
* Would it be more effective and clearer if theres one UI for fish and another for company, going to try with one first *

* Adding in a view game for the user "to go fishing" to see the information on the fish and companys *

  Need to find a way to include inheritance
  Need to find a way to connect the CoOrdinate class and Fish class (maybe inheritance but which way)
  Might make a petition sign up to help with making change to have another class

  Can use a database to add a display function of the data, plus have the numbers for the fish be sent through Fish to calculate the sum caught and wasted, to go to the CoOrdinate class for presenting the info 
  Not sure if the Fish and CoOrdinate class willl work for inheritance

  Adding display and a text field to enter date for logs, could possible have a bit for the most fish day for a species
  Need to construct the results for the squares, either make it a random selected reply (like the class picks a number between 1 and 6 and depending on what it lands out is the ouput) or assign a response for each square
  ->random may work better

  Need to put a pin in connecting the two classes and just get the application to work then try the connection
  Only way I can see how this part working is in one class for everything 

  can possible make a search to generlise the table like date 

  - Need to add another class, maybe can make the database the subclass of fish so the waste and total caught
  - Make the entered not an array just single out put

  Got log system and fish to work, with display also
  Need to figure out one more response for the CoOrdinate, made it tha it picks a number from 1 to 8 and each number refers to a response
  Want to make it the once the add button is pressed to entered data disappears not just the labels and text fields
